    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "* Learn how ``tbb::global_control`` and ``tbb::task_arena`` work together to set the maximum available concurrency for computations\n",
    "\n",
    "# Controlling the number of threads used by oneTBB\n",
    "\n",
    "oneTBB has a global pool of worker threads and one or more task arenas. Together, the pool of worker threads \n",
    "and the task arenas are referred to as the TBB scheduler. If we do nothing special, the oneTBB library \n",
    "creates a thread pool with P-1 worker threads, where P is the number of hardware threads supported by the CPUs (`std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`). And, by default, all TBB tasks are shared in a single, implicit task \n",
    "arena that contains enough slots for the main thread and the P-1 worker threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, these defaults are the best configuration, providing good scalability while avoiding oversubscription. \n",
    "Whenever we execute a TBB algorithm, use a TBB flow graph or create tasks, all the work is scheduled on to this \n",
    "limited set of threads that are scheduled by the OS on to the CPU cores. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are scenarios that can benefit from changing these defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some reasons we might change the number of threads used by a parallel computation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We know that our computations have limited scalability and that using more than a certain number of threads will just add scheduling overheads.\n",
    "* Our tasks consume a lot of resources when executing, and so we need to limit the number of tasks that execute concurrently.\n",
    "* We want to leave room on our platform for other work, and so we want to limit the number of cores used concurrently by a particular computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threading Building Blocks provides two classes that can be used to limit the maximum concurrency \n",
    "used by parallel computations: ``tbb::global_control`` and ``tbb::task_arena``.  Each serves a different \n",
    "purpose but together they determine the maximum number of threads our parallel computations can use\n",
    "concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we work through a few exercises to better understand how to use `tbb::global_control` \n",
    "and `tbb::task_arena` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A simple scalability study\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first set of exercises, we will run a very simple parallel loop that executes its loop body 1 million times, spinning in each invocation of the body for about 1 microsecond. The sum of the times for all the iterations therefore equals about 1 second. We will make a series of modifications to this example to better understand the impact of `tbb::global_control` and `tbb::task_arena` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The default case\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do nothing special, oneTBB creates P-1 workers and executes tasks in an implicit task area with P slots. In this section, we build and execute a base case that uses these defaults. Our test will track the number of unique threads that participate in the computation and print out the execution time and the number of threads that participated. When we run the base case, we should expect to see that the number of threads used in the computation are equal to `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()` and that the time to execute the parallel loop is roughly 1 second / P. We shouldn't expect the time to be exactly\n",
    "1/P since there is overhead in parallel scheduling and because the spin loop in our test loop is not precise -- in fact it executes for *at least* 1 microsecond \n",
    "not *exactly* 1 microsecond, so we should expect the time to be bigger than 1/P, but not a lot bigger.  You can see the details of the\n",
    "function `run_test` in common/test_function.h.\n",
    "\n",

    "As we noted above this might be because the developer knows that the parallelism won't scale beyond a certain point or that the \n",

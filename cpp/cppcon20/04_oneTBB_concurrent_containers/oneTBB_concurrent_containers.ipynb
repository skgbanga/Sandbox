    "## A Producer-Consumer Application with tbb::concurrent_priority_queue\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will implement a very simple producer-consumer application that uses a shared \n",
    "priority queue. A producer thread will generate 1000 items, putting them into a queue and a consumer \n",
    "thread will read the items from the queue, generating a sum of the values as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run the sequential baseline implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In our baseline implementation, the producer thread and the consumer thread are the same thread, the main thread.\n",
    "There is no concurrency expressed in our serial code, but if there was, we would have a race condition since we\n",
    "use a `std::priority_queue`. In the `while`-loop, we call `empty` before calling `pop`. If more than one thread\n",
    "was simultaneously popping from this shared queue, the queue might appear non-empty at the test in the `while`-loop\n",
    "but be empty by the time `pop` is called. This problem does not exist in our serial code since only one thread is\n",
    "used. In the next section, we will add concurrency and the potential for such a race condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, just inspect the sequential code below - there are no modifications necessary. Run the first cell \n",
    "to create the file, then run the cell below it to compile and execute the code. This represents the baseline for \n",
